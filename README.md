Milestone 3
For your last and final assignment for this class, you'll put together one more project using the tools that you've learned, and some new tools (like better login & persisting data) that are meant to help take you from 0 - 60.

Requirements
App
At a high level, the requirements for this project are:

Your app should have at least one public page, a way to login, and something private that your users see after login
Your app should have Create/Read/Update/Delete functionality for any user-supplied data (text, images, etc)
If you really want to do a native mobile app you can, but you're on your own in terms of support.
Group work
Group work is optional - so its up to you. Here are the rules:

Max 3 people
All work needs to be submitted to the shared codebase
Each member of the team is responsible for at least 1 feature that creates, reads, and updates some data. This does NOT mean that one person can work on creating data, another person works on viewing data, etc.
If you use Firebase to host your app, the Firebase account can only be owned by one person.
If your group is having problems or some people are not contributing, please email me and let me know ASAP.
Part 1 - Prototype It
For Part 1 - you'll make a rough prototype of your idea - enough to answer the question - "What is your app, and what does it do?"

If you're working on a project as part of another course, you can see if it meets the criteria above. The only additional requirement I have is that I need to be able to see your work (commits + code).

If you've got your own idea for a project you want to build, fantastic!

If you don't have your own idea, you can use one of these 2:

Social Media Image/Message Sharing app
Chatroom App
You can't do these:

To-Do app
Notes app
Milestone 2 app
Once you've chosen what you want to build, it's time to put together your product overview.

Submission
Create a rough wireframe using Figma to describe your app visually and include a link to a publicly viewable Figma wireframe.
Submit a 1-pager product overview document describing the features of your app idea as shown in your Figma wireframe, some of the use cases that it addresses, and how some of the features are used on each page.
Part 2 - Build It
If you're working on a team - each member of the team is responsible for at least 1 feature AND you need to show this via Git commits. You'll only receive credit if I can see each person's Git commits.

You can use Milestone 2 as the base for your project, but it should still include substantial contributions to the project to make it different. 

If you'd like to use a different stack altogether, thats perfectly fine! You can choose your own adventure.

Its also ok for your built app to look different than your wireframes. Your wireframes should serve as a guide.

There should be a way of logging in - we'll be using Firebase Auth during the class.
There should be a form or some inputs that are shown to the user, and you send the data to your backend - we'll be using Firebase Firestore during the class.
You should be able to save the user's data and display it back to them - we'll be using React for this.
Once you've built your feature, setup hosting for your site and deploy your changes to your live environment. Grading will be based on your live environment.

Submission
Submit a link to your Github repository containing the work, as well as screenshots of the application and a brief description of how your features work so that I can review it.
If you're working on a team, each person should have their own commits in their repo
Submit a screenshot showing some of the data in your Firestore Collection. If you're using a different database, submit a screenshot wherever your data may be.
Submit a link to your public URL
Part 3 - Run It
Submission
Once you've deployed your site, its time to be able to review your running application. Navigate around your app to generate some traffic and data, and submit screenshots and a short answer for each question below.

If you wind up deploying to a different hosting platform, you should still be able to find all this information, it'll just be different than what you find on Firebase.

Review traffic to your app

How many requests did you receive?
How do you know if it was human or a bot?
Measuring frontend performance

What is the max CPU usage of your page?
What is the max memory that it uses?
How fast did your page load?
How much data was transferred?
Measuring backend performance 

How many requests did you make to your database?
 

Grading
5 pts: Prototype It Submit a wireframe and a description of your app

10 pts: Build It Add login, implement Create/Read/Update/Delete functionality for your data

5 pts: Run It Deploy your site, and submit metrics from your running site

Submitting
We'll use Github Classroom once more, but there's no template in this repo. You are free to copy files over from Milestone 2 if you'd like to use that structure. If you'd like to use your own tech stack, thats fine too. One advantage of using GH Classroom once more is that it takes care of group permissions so that I don't have to.

You can always move your repo or your code out of Github Classroom so you can continue working on it after the semester is over.

GH Classroom is configured for Group assignments, so if you'd like to work solo, create a group with your Cornell ID in it, i.e. "da335". If you're going to work in a group, name your group or select an already created group. If you join a group accidentally, there doesn't seem to be a way of fixing it in GH Classroom, so please email me to let me know.

Once you're ready, start by accepting your GH Classroom Invite - https://classroom.github.com/a/ye0j79O4Links to an external site.

Note: Submissions are disabled until groups get imported into Canvas for grading.
