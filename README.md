# Course Probe CT

Welcome to Course Probe CT, an unofficial course review website for Cornell Tech.

## About

Course Probe CT is a platform designed to help Cornell Tech students make informed decisions about their courses(as they don't have much choices:). It allows students to read and write reviews about courses, providing valuable insights into class content, teaching style, workload, and overall experience.

### Commuity Guidelines

What kind of content is appropriate?

We value free speech, but we encourage reviews that:

- Focus on the course learning experience
- Share your personal experience (only review courses you've taken)
- Avoid emotionally charged statements, personal attacks, or hate speech


## Deployment

The website is deployed and hosted on Vercel. You can visit the live site at [https://courseprobect.vercel.app].
